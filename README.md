# MSI Builder (temp name)

This project is to create a command line tool that can be used on both Windows
and Linux to create an MSI deliverable. The best alternative that I can find is
the [msitools](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/msitools) project but the
documentation for that tool is nearly non-existent and many features are lacking
such as CustomActions.
